*********** How to Run ***********
Just cd to the p7 directory in command line, then run:
python3 web.py

That will start the server. Open a web browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080/contacts


*********** What to Do ***********
You should see a list of all customer basic contacts on the ecommerce.db database.

Next to each is a 'View Details' link. Clicking on the link will navigate you
to the customer's detailed contact page, which includes his/her billing and shipping addresses.

Per assignment instructions, this example web server shows:
1) URL in one page that leads the user to another page
2) URL and the page you're taken to is dynamically generated based on primary id
3) All pages access the ecommerce.db included in the p7 directory
