PROJECT UPDATES
---------------------------------------------

After speaking to TA on Monday, I've updated and reduced the scope of my project to something
more reasonable, but extendable if needed for added functionalities.

First and foremost, the tax-related attributes have been removed. I would have needed to create
an entire set of taxes for different city, county, and state, perhaps even internationally to 
match with the random address generator from Python's Faker module.

In addition, calculations of this sort should be done at the application level and handed down
to the DBMS simply for storage as a record of how much tax was paid. The calculations should
not be done in the database itself.

Additionally the Discounts entity has been removed as it was not a critical part of the database.
