DATABASE FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL IDEAS

1. Database for 3-Way Ecommerce Marketplace
In 2014, I launched an online modern furniture retailer Froy (https://froy.com).
I built the store on Shopify, which is a 2-way marketplace consisting of customers and the retailer (us).
Froy has 15 suppliers, none of whom can create their own wholesale account to manage product data,
update stock, and other basic operations. Existing wholesale account plugins are lacking
in features, cumbersome to use, or lack enforcement of standardizations (ex., product image format).

I would be interested in building a database for a 3-way marketplace that consists of accounts/entities
for primary retailer, 3rd-party sellers/suppliers, and end-customers. My present intuition is that
we may need to consider distinct entitities for businesses and individuals. That allows the retailer
and suppliers to support employee accounts, each of whom can even be customers of the store.
The marketplace will also contain the usual ecommerce entities - orders, products, and collections.

Products are hard and have many attributes - unique handle, name, price, SKU, type hierarchy, stock, 
variants (colors, sizes), collection, description, and reviews. Orders will have products, customer, 
fulfillment status (paid, shipped, delivered, refund requested, etc.). Collections are a set of products
filtered for some set of rules.


2. Database for Live Streaming App
As part of my iOS App Dev class' final project, we need to build a fully functioning app that can
publish to the Apple App Store. I'd love to build something modern (i.e., use the most recent features
on Swift/XCode announced at WWDC) that can integrate knolwedge from other classes such as Databases.
Although boomers claim to hate apps like TikTok, I believe they are a study in great consumer tech
and application development. I would love to build some live streaming app for educational purpose.
On the surface, the project is simple - imagine an app solely focused on building around 
Twitch's Just Chatting channel or TikTok/Instagram's live streaming feature, nothing more.
