PROJECT UPDATES
---------------------------------------------

After speaking to TA on Monday, I made some improvements to me relations.
Specifically, the variants are no longer classified (incorrectly) as a weak entity.
Orders now point to variants (rather than products) for its relationship.
Thus, the previous ord_prod table is now replaced with the new ord_var table.
Fake data generator has been updated to reflect these updates, as has all the .sql and .db files.
